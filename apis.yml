      nOps is an AWS-focused cloud management platform that helps engineering
      and FinOps teams cut costs, improve governance, and keep environments
      well-architected. It ingests AWS billing and telemetry data (such as CUR,
      CloudTrail, and CloudWatch) to surface real-time insights, flag anomalies,
      and recommend actions like rightsizing, eliminating idle resources,
      scheduling non‑production workloads, optimizing EBS/S3, and increasing
      efficient use of Spot. nOps also automates savings through commitment
      management for Savings Plans and Reserved Instances, and provides tools
      for cost allocation, tagging hygiene, and Kubernetes/EKS cost
      optimization. Beyond cost, it continuously checks environments against AWS
      Well-Architected and other best practices, enabling ongoing compliance,
      change tracking, and remediation so teams can reduce spend, boost
      reliability, and move faster with confidence.

description: >-
  nOps is an AI-powered cloud cost visibility and optimization platform that
  helps organizations reduce their AWS spending by 50% or more through
  autonomous management and automation. The platform provides 100% visibility
  into cloud costs across AWS, GCP, Azure, Kubernetes, GenAI, and SaaS
  applications, enabling teams to allocate and track spending by customer,
  product, cost center, or any other dimension even without complete tagging.
  nOps uses machine learning to continuously optimize compute resources across
  Reserved Instances, Savings Plans, and Spot instances, while its Compute
  Copilot specifically reduces EKS and ASG costs through automatic environment
  optimization. The platform also automates time-consuming cost optimization
  tasks by learning usage patterns, identifying idle resources, and turning them
  off automatically to eliminate waste. Managing over $2 billion in annual AWS
  spend for more than 500 customers ranging from startups to enterprises, nOps
  addresses the common problem that 30% of cloud spend is waste and helps
  organizations move away from expensive on-demand pricing that makes up 20% of
  typical compute costs.
